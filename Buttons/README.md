# Buttons

## Problem

>There is a website running at [Link](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:18342) . Try to see if you can push their buttons.

## Hints

>Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Solution

In this problem, we need a little bit knowledge about sever and client.

First, open the link, we will see a button named "PUSH ME! I am your only hope!". Click it and we get into new page : **.../button1.php**

We find the 2nd button named: "BUtton2". Click it and we are failed...... 

Since the page direct us to **.../boo.html** instead of **.../button2.php**
